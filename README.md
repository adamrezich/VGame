- input system - handles key and mouse button press, down, and release states for you
- source enginesque command system, including key and mouse button bindings for command, a command console, and console variables

Notice
------

VGame is super early and *super* undocumented. I'm basically making as I work on my other project, [Arena](http://github.com/adamrezich/arena), implementing stuff and adding features as I need them.

You really oughtn't use it for your own stuff yet.
