GameState is an object that contains everything that the server knows that the
client needs to know. Ideally, a GameState would be sent to each client, every
tick (66.66 times per second).

Since that would be crazy, instead we only send any variables that have changed
since the last time we sent stuff to that client... meaning,


cl_updaterate 20
	Rate set by the client to get GameState snapshot updates from the server.
	Clamped to sv_minupaterate and sv_maxupdaterate.
rate 12000
	Rate, in bytes per second, a client can receive data. Client will be kicked
	from the server if their rate is less than sv_minrate, and it will be
	clamped to sv_maxrate.
cl_cmdrate 30
	Rate set by the client to send input data to the server.
cl_lerp 0.1
